# PizzaMaker wants to handle bulk orders of pizzas, with varying amounts of toppings on each. Ask the user for a number of pizzas - call it quantity. We then want to ask the user for quantity more numbers - the number of toppings on that pizza - and print them out as in the following example.
#
# How many pizzas do you want to order?
# $ 3
# How many toppings for pizza 1?
# $ 5
# You have ordered a pizza with 5 toppings.
# How many toppings for pizza 2?
# $ 1
# You have ordered a pizza with 1 toppings.
# How many toppings for pizza 3?
# $ 4
# You have ordered a pizza with 4 toppings.
# You will need:
#
# to ask the user for input twice.
# a loop of some kind.
# to make sure your variables are what you think they are! Convert them to integers if needed.
# string interpolation
# In this example the string "Chunky bacon!" will be printed 3 times and the block of code specified was puts "Chunky bacon!"

puts "How many pizzas do you want to order?"
quantity = gets.chomp.to_i
i = 0

quantity.times do |i|
  i += 1
  puts "How many toppings for pizza #{i}?"
  toppings = gets.chomp.to_i
  puts "You have ordered a pizza with #{toppings} toppings"
end
